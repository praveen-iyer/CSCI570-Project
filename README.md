## About the project
For sequence alignment problem, we have implemented 2 versions - basic and efficient.<br/>

For the basic version, the algorithm implemented can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sequence-alignment-problem/).<br/><br/>

For the efficient version, the algorithm implemented can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschberg%27s_algorithm).

The time complexity vs input size can be shown below.

The memory complexity vs input size can be shown below.
